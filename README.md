### About RISC-V

[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/about/) is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration.

The RISC-V ISA delivers a new level of free, extensible software and hardware freedom on architecture, paving the way for the next 50 years of computing design and innovation.

RISC-V has broken down barriers in the semiconductor industry, bringing together different companies, industries, and geographies for open collaboration. 

RISC-V combines a modular technical approach with an open license business model, meaning that anyone, anywhere can leverage the IP contributed and produced by RISC-V International.

RISC-V International is a global nonprofit association based in Switzerland. Founded in 2015 as the RISC-V Foundation with 29 members, is now a truly global organization with 2k+ members in more than 70 countries.

Incorporated in Switzerland, RISC-V International is truly a global organization. As a non-profit, RISC-V International does not maintain any commercial interest in products or services. 

RISC-V also does not take a political position on behalf of any geography. We are proud to see organizations from around the world working together in this new era of processor innovation.
